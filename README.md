# Paperdoll

A scala implementation of the paper:
[Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf)

Essentially a Free Monad that can contain multiple independent effects
(and without needing the Coyoneda trick for non-Functor effects).
New effect "layers" can be added onto the stack, or "unpeeled"
out of the stack, without the implementation of one layer needing to
be aware of any other layers.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/m50d/paperdoll.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/m50d/paperdoll)

## How to use

TODO

## Features

 * A [Free Monad](http://underscore.io/blog/posts/2015/04/14/free-monads-are-simple.html) equivalent
  * i.e. for any datatype you like, you can extend that datatype to a "command object",
where commands are composed of instance of that datatype and custom functions
  * Note there is no need for the `Coyoneda` trick in this implementation
 * Free monads let you [separate the declaration of a computation from its implementation
 ](http://michaelxavier.net/posts/2014-04-27-Cool-Idea-Free-Monads-for-Testing-Redis-Calls.html)
  * Can use multiple interpreters to run the same monadic computation e.g. test vs live
 * Freer monads let you interleave multiple monadic effects without the complexities of monad transformers
  * Both definition of effects and of interpreters can be completely separate (even in separate codebases)
 * Implementation is compatible with ScalaZ Monads
  * i.e. you can use existing ScalaZ-compatible functions like `traverse` on paperdoll effect stacks.
 * Adapters to allow you to use popular monads from existing libraries as effect layers.
 * Improving on the paper, Paperdoll uses a `Coproduct`-based representation for the effect stack,
 allowing effects to be reordered and interpreted in in different orders by different interpreter stacks. 

## Non-features and rationales

 * Contributions of layers for more popular monadsare very welcome;
 instances and support code for an external library "foo"
 should be placed in a new `paperdoll-foo` maven module.
 * The `send` in the paper is equivalent to `send` followed by `extend` in Paperdoll.
 * `Eff#extend` is implemented naÃ¯vely and adds overhead to the entire stack it's applied to.
 Therefore the performance of a construct like `f.flatMap(g).extend[...].flatMap(h).extend[...]`
 is likely quadratic rather than linear as it should be.
 Indeed it may be worse than that, since `.extend` fixes a blob in the tree-like queue structure,
 so composing with further operations won't rebalance the tree
 and we lose the efficient "reflection without remorse" structure.
 So the behaviour may actually be cubic.
 On the other hand the implementation is the same as that in `handleRelay`,
 so this aspect of the behaviour is no worse than what the original Haskell implementation
 would do for a chain of `f flatMap g |> handleA flatMap h |> handleB ...`
 Note that a `for { x <- f.extend[...] ; y <- g.extend[...] ; z <- h.extend[...] } yield ...`
 construct should still behave linearly, so I believe this is not a problem in practice; patches are very welcome.
 * Use of type members vs. type parameters is arguably inconsistent in places, as is general style.
 In some cases this is deliberate pragmatism so as to ensure that the types can be used in practice;
 in others I couldn't get type inference to work correctly with a more natural representation.
 * Compilation time is really awful, particularly in the case of errors.
 * There are no performance tests. I don't have time to do these, but would welcome contributions.
 * There is no automatic binary compatibility checking in the build. MiMA seems to only support SBT, not maven.
 I find the maintainability advantages of maven compelling and will not accept patches to convert to SBT,
 but any implementation of binary compatibility checking in the maven build would be very welcome.
 * Paperdoll depends on ScalaZ since it makes extensive use of `Leibniz`. I would prefer to depend on Cats
 but this functionality is a firm requirement. I also use a feature of `MonadPlus` that I don't believe
 is presently implemented in cats.
 * I have not implemented the `MonadCatchIO` example from the paper as there is no single established
 IO monad implementation in Scala.

## Implementation notes

In several places where there is a multi-parameter type `F[X, Y]`
I have added a corresponding:

    sealed trait F_[X] {
      final type O[X, Y] = F[X, Y]
    }

so that `F_[X]#O` can be used to express the partially applied type
instead of a type lambda. Any type ending in `_` is likely to be
an instance of this pattern.

Algebraic data types generally offer a `fold` method which is designed
to be the safe equivalent of a pattern match. When reviewing Scala
[it is difficult to distinguish between safe and unsafe pattern matches](
http://typelevel.org/blog/2014/11/10/why_is_adt_pattern_matching_allowed.html),
so my preferred style is to avoid pattern matches entirely.
This also makes it possible to hide trait implementation subtypes
(by using anonymous classes) where appropriate.

As `paperdoll-core` is very abstract, a lot of tests for `paperdoll-core` code
require one or more effect implementations.
So I've moved those tests down into `paperdoll-all` rather than add test-only effects.

The project is split into a large number of small modules,
primarily to prove that the interpreters truly are independent.

I am a great admirer of [the circe philosophy](https://github.com/travisbrown/circe/blob/v0.3.0/DESIGN.md),
but this project is in many respects an opposite: I think there is value
in demonstrating that freer monads can be implemented in a very strictly safe
subset of Scala, and that is the primary goal for this project.
A more pragmatic project would likely provide the same API,
but make use of unsafe casts internally for performance.

## Conduct

This project does not have a code of conduct. Please raise
any conduct issues either via the issue tracker or directly
with me (Michael Donaghy) by email to md401@srcf.ucam.org.
If you want to talk about a conduct matter privately I will
respect that - I will likely be unwilling to act on an allegation
if you want to keep the allegation and/or your identity private
(I think it's important that project participants be protected
from anonymous accusations), but you can always talk to me
and I won't take any public actions without your consent.

The following is explicitly not a code and not binding,
but is a guide to my current thinking on issues that I have
seen arise elsewhere. My decision is final in all cases:

 * Be polite. Correctness is no excuse for rudeness.
  * At times it may be even better to not answer at all if you
  know the answer to a (technical or other) question but are not
  able or willing to express that answer politely.
  * This applies particularly when interacting with newcomers
  to the project, the language, or programming in general.
 * I expect discussion to occur on a wide variety of subjects,
 not necessarily "on-topic". However everyone has the right to disengage
 from a particular topic and others should respect that.
  * Note that this applies even to technical matters.
  It's correct to be wary of the [XY problem](http://xyproblem.info/),
  but if someone has a particular requirement and is not interested
  in discussing why they have that requirement, respect that.
 * If any participant requests some reasonable accommodation for themselves
 (including but not limited to: referring to them in a particular
 fashion or none, not discussing particular topics in project spaces
 (provided those topics are not directly relevant to the project))
 please respect that. If you find an accommodation that someone
 else has requested to be onerous then please raise this as a
 conduct issue.
  * Generally I will either require participants to make that
  accommodation or add the non-accommodation to the Content Notes
  section of this document.
  * Please request accommodations only in good faith and only for yourself.

I will generally look to resolve conduct issues amicably through
discussion wherever possible. In cases where this fails,
the only sanction I am able or willing to impose is temporary
or permanent banning from project spaces. Cases of serious harassment
remain a matter for law enforcement, not project governance.

I ask those on the banlist not to participate in community spaces
associated with this project, including but not limited
to the issue tracker and wiki.
The banlist does not affect your license to the software.
I may or may not take technical measures to enforce bans;
the presence or absence of a technical ban measure should not be taken
to imply the existence of a ban not on the list in this document,
or the nonexistence of a ban on this list in the document.
If a technical ban measure is preventing you from participating
but your name is not listed in this document, please file an
issue if possible, or email me at md401@srcf.ucam.org if you
cannot file an issue. 

### Banlist

 * Tony Morris (indefinite)

### Content Notes

Paperdoll source code may contain sexualised elements, and discussion
around it may be or become sexualised. Individuals who find sexualised
code or conversation inherently threatening are advised not to
contribute to this project or participate in its spaces. 

### Rationale

Conduct has sadly become an issue in the Scala community of late.
Some projects have responded by adopting codes of conduct.
In my view such codes have been counterproductive on the whole:
they necessitate all the downsides of a formal process,
but are rarely clear and objective enough to ensure consistent,
predictable handling of incidents or allegations.

The TypeLevel Code of Conduct in particular has been ambiguously enforced
with very little accountability. Specifically, the inconsistent
statements from Lars Hupel and Miles Sabin at various times
regarding alleged violation (or not) of the Code of Conduct
by Tony Morris are irreconcilable with the basic principles
of transparency and accountability in project governance.
I believe this was an inappropriate use of a Code of Conduct,
that likely arose out of an unwillingness to directly confront
a specific individual who was causing problems. But I also believe
that adopting a code within a small project inherently leads
those involved to inappropriately overgeneralise.
Therefore I explicitly intend handle conduct issues in Paperdoll
at a personal/individual level, unless and until I become experienced
enough to set good general policies.

Mr Morris has upset people (including newcomers and myself)
in Scala-related spaces on numerous occasions. I find it implausible
that his statements were not intended to upset their recipients,
and in any case he has been repeatedly warned about them by many people.
My decision to ban him is taken in full awareness of his contributions to the Scala
community (in particular as founder of ScalaZ, which Paperdoll depends on);
while such contributions are laudable they do not make the things he says
any less unacceptable.

Paperdoll is an act of artistic self-expression (though it is also intended
as a production-standard library). Sex is part of human life
and I do not think it appropriate or healthy to pretend otherwise;
therefore sexualised code has its place in the project.
(I mention this as a content note because it differs from the TypeLevel Code of Conduct,
which states "participants and community organizers should not use
sexualized images, activities, or other material").
