# Paperdoll

A scala implementation of the paper:
[Freer Monads, More Extensible Effects](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf)

Essentially a Free Monad that can contain multiple independent effects
(and without needing the Coyoneda trick for non-Functor effects).
New effect "layers" can be added onto the stack, or "unpeeled"
out of the stack, without the implementation of one layer needing to
be aware of any other layers.
